Function used from pandas library:-

    -> nunique() & unique()
        1)
        2) DataFram.nunique()
            It shows the total no. of unique values in each column.
            It can be applied on a single columns well as on whole dataframe.
            
            
    -> count()
        It shows the total no. of non-null values in each column.
        It can be applied on a single columns well as on whole dataframe.
        
        
    -> value_counts()
        In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count.
        It can be applied on a single column only.
        
    -> Filtering
    
    
    -> groupby
        DataFrame.groupby('Col_Name') --> Refer to the column
        cannot be use alone
        use it with getgroup()
        
        
    -> get_group()
        DataFrame.groupby('Col_Name').get_group('Element_Name')
        Will give all the record which have 'Element_Name' as value in the column name as 'Col_Name'
        
        
    -> isnull() & notnull()
        Check for null data is present or not
    
    
    -> rename()
        DataFrame.rename(columns = {'old_col_name' : 'new_col_name'})
        
        
    -> mean()
    -> std()
    -> var()
    -> min() & max()
    
    
    -> str.contains
        w_data['Weather Condition'].str.contains('Snow')
        Give the output as boolean
        It will search for key word as 'Snow' in the Weather condition column
        All the terms with 'Snow' will get extracted
        Examples --> Snow, Snow Showers, Snow Fog, .......
        Now to get the data frame from above boolean result:-
            w_data[w_data['Weather Condition'].str.contains('Snow')]
            
            
    -> And (&) Operator
        Condition_1 & Condtion_2
        Will give the output as True When both conditions are True
        
        
    -> Or (|) Operator
        Condition_1 | Condtion_2
        Will give the output as True When any one of the conditions is True
