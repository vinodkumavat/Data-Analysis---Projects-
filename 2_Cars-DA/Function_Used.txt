1) car.dropna()

    Removes all the null entry records from dataset
    Give the copy of datafram with no Null records present
    To make permanent to the dataFrame work 
        car = car.dropna()




2) car['Origin'].isin(['Asia', 'Europe'])

    From the column = Origin it will check for the 'Asia' or 'Europe'
    If any one is present then it will give true
    The result from above will be in boolean form
    To get the result as dataFrame
        car[(car['Origin'] == 'Asia') | (car['Origin'] == 'Europe')]
        
        
        
        
3) car['MPG_City'] = car['MPG_City'].apply(lambda x:x+3)

    From the column = MPG_City
    Using apply function
    apply function uses the lambda method --> (which is used in excel)
    update the new column as => New_Column = Old_column + 3
