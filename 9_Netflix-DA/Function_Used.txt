1) duplicate()
    Give the boolean result of data where the record is duplicate
    To get the dataframe type of data which is duplicate
        dF[dF.duplicated()]
        


2) data.drop_duplicates()
    Will delete the duplicate records from the dataframe
    will return the copy of dataframe which is free from duplicate records
    To make the changes permanent
        data.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)




3) str.split('**', expand = True)
    ** = needs to substitute the character about which we need to split the string
    


5) countplot()
    It is part of seaborn library
    syntax => sns.countplot(dF['col_name'])
